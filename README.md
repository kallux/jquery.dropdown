jquery.dropdown
===============

A simple jQuery plugin to create stylable and customizable dropdown menus. The menu is navigatable with the arrow keys, options can be selected with ```enter``` and the menu can be closed with the ```esc``` key.

Usage
-----
``` html
<head>
  <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
  <script src="jquery.dropdown.js"></script>
</head>
```
``` html
<div class="dropdown">
  <div class="dropdown-head">
    <span class="title" unselectable="on">-- Default Option --</span><span class="caret"></span>
  </div>
  <ul class="dropdown-body">
    <li data-value="0" unselectable="on">First Value</li>
    <li data-value="1" unselectable="on">Second Value</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

You can either just include this in the HTML head
``` html
<script>
  $(window).ready(function() {
    $('.dropdown').dropdown(alert);
  });
</script>
```
or run the code right after the required DOM elements are parsed. The function ```dropdown()``` takes a callback function that is run when a menu option is selected. The ```data-value``` is sent as an argument to the callback function. Also callbacks are called in scope, so ```this``` refers to the parent ```<div class="dropdown" />``` which can be useful for finding the caller (if there are many with the same callback).
